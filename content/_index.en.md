# Hello, I'm Léon

Web developer and computer science student, I turn ideas into tangible digital solutions. Technical innovation drives me, both in creating web applications and building FPV drones, my favorite pastime.

Precision, creativity, and adaptability define my work. Every line of code I write aims to efficiently solve a real problem.
