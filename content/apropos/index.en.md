Beyond the academic framework, I constantly develop my skills through **personal projects** and **technical challenges**. This self-taught approach allows me to stay at the forefront of modern web technologies.

## üíª My Development Philosophy

{{< timeline >}}
{{< timelineItem icon="heart" header="User-Centered" badge="Priority #1" >}}
Every feature, every interface is designed to offer the <strong>best possible experience</strong>. I firmly believe that a good developer must first understand the real needs of users.
