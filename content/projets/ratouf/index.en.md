# RaTouf - Chiroptera Data Analysis

Specialized application for integrating and analyzing data from bat ultrasonic recordings to optimize validation and transmission processes to ECO-MED's SIN.

## üéØ Objective

RaTouf facilitates the transfer of chiroptera acoustic data from SonoChiro to ECO-MED's Naturalist Information System (SIN). The application automates species identification validation and calculates activity levels according to scientific references.

## üîç Problem Solved

Before RaTouf, chiropterological data integration was entirely manual:
- Tedious import of SonoChiro CSV files
- Individual validation of thousands of identifications
- Manual activity level calculations
- Transcription error risks
- Considerable processing time for experts

## ‚ö° Main Features

### Smart Import and Parsing
- **Automatic analysis** of SonoChiro CSV files
- **Adaptive detection** of formats and structural variations
- **Robust handling** of missing or inconsistent data
- **Data preview** before processing

### Assisted Scientific Validation
- **Taxonomic correspondence** with TAXREF reference
- **Phonic group management** (acoustically similar species)
- **Intuitive validation interface** for experts
- **Automatic flagging** of doubtful identifications

### Automatic Activity Level Calculation
- **Multi-reference algorithms** (Barataud, TeamChiro, etc.)
- **Contextual adaptation** according to season and habitat
- **Automatic classification**: Low, Moderate, High, Very High
- **Traceability** of calculation methods used

### SIN Integration
- **Direct communication** with SIN's ArcGIS API
- **Retrieval of existing** recording sessions
- **Duplicate avoidance** through intelligent matching
- **Secure transmission** of validated data

## üñºÔ∏è User Interface

### Main Analysis Screen
![RaTouf Main Interface](RaTouf.webp)

RaTouf's interface clearly presents:
- Recording sessions to process
- SIN correspondence status
- Detailed data per species
- Calculated activity levels

### Taxonomic Visualizer
![Taxonomic Visualizer](Visualisateur%20Taxonomique%20des%20Chiropt√®res.webp)

Advanced tool for navigating chiroptera taxonomy, allowing exploration of relationships between species and phonic groups.

### Session Correspondence Management
![Session Selection](selection%20chauve%20souris%20ratouf.webp)

Interface for matching SonoChiro sessions with SIN sessions, with exception case management.

### Identification Details

#### Species Found in SIN
![Found Species Details](detaille%20chauve%20souris%20touv√©%20RaTouf.webp)

Detailed view for species already present in SIN, with data comparison.

#### New Identifications
![New Species Details](detaille%20chauve%20souris%20non%20touv√©%20RaTouf.webp)

Interface for processing new identifications not present in SIN.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Integration**: ArcGIS REST API, SonoChiro CSV
- **Database**: MongoDB (via ECO-MED Hub)
- **Authentication**: JWT integrated with Azure AD

### Specialized Services

#### ChiroptereService
- Chiroptera taxonomic data management
- Correspondence between phonic codes and CD_NOM
- Species identification validation

#### ActivityLevelCalculator
- Implementation of activity calculation algorithms
- Multi-reference support (Barataud, TeamChiro, etc.)
- Contextual adaptation according to season and habitat

#### DataProcessor
- Robust parsing of SonoChiro CSV files
- Imported data cleaning and validation
- Automatic anomaly detection

#### SessionValidator
- Correspondence between SonoChiro and SIN sessions
- Temporal and geographical consistency validation
- Exception case management

## üî¨ Scientific Innovation

### Phonic Group Management
RaTouf innovates in managing **acoustically similar species groups**. Unlike traditional taxonomic approaches, the application recognizes that certain species (e.g., Cryptic Myotis/Escalera's Myotis) cannot be differentiated by their ultrasonic emissions.

### Adaptive Activity Algorithms
The application implements **contextual algorithms** that adapt activity thresholds according to:
- Time of year (reproduction, migration, hibernation)
- Habitat type (forest, prairie, wetland)
- Weather conditions
- Recording method used

## üìä Results and Impact

### Operational Gains
- ‚è±Ô∏è **90%** reduction in data processing time
- üéØ **95%** reliability in validated identifications
- üìà **100%** automation of activity calculations
- üîÑ **Elimination** of manual transcription errors

### Regulatory Compliance
- ‚úÖ **Automated transmission** to INPN via SIN
- ‚úÖ **Compliance with** SINP and TAXREF standards
- ‚úÖ **Complete traceability** of data and processing
- ‚úÖ **Scientific validation** by experts


## üéì Skills Developed

### Technical
- Complex data parsing and validation
- Acoustic analysis algorithms
- Third-party API integration (ArcGIS)
- Taxonomic data management
- Performance optimization

### Business
- Applied chiropterology expertise
- Knowledge of activity references
- Understanding of conservation issues
- Scientific validation processes
