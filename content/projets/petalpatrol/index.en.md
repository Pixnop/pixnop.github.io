{{< /lead >}}

# PetalPatrol - Botanical Inventory Management

Application dedicated to digitizing and optimizing floristic inventory processes for ECO-MED's botanical teams, facilitating collection, validation and analysis of plant species data.

## üéØ Objective

PetalPatrol simplifies and automates botanical inventory management by enabling intuitive field data entry, rigorous taxonomic validation and in-depth analysis of floristic data collected during environmental studies.

## üå± Problem Solved

Before PetalPatrol, botanical inventory management presented several challenges:
- **Time-consuming field data entry** prone to errors
- **Manual taxonomic validation** that was tedious
- **Difficult centralization** of multi-site data
- **Limited statistical analyses** of plant communities
- **Complex regulatory compliance** with TAXREF standards

## ‚ö° Main Features

### Optimized field data entry interface
- **Adaptive forms** according to survey type
- **Automatic species suggestions** by habitat
- **Real-time validation** of nomenclature
- **Offline mode** for areas without network coverage

### Advanced taxonomic management
- **TAXREF integration** for official nomenclature
- **Automatic synonymic correspondences**
- **Management of botanical** groups and families
- **Detection of heritage** and invasive species

### Integrated ecological analyses
- **Diversity indices** (Shannon, Simpson, Pielou)
- **Correspondence analyses** between surveys
- **Automatic mapping** of observations
- **Customizable statistical reports**

### Validation and quality control
- **Automatic verification** of ecological consistency
- **Flagging of doubtful** observations
- **Expert validation workflow**
- **Complete traceability** of modifications
