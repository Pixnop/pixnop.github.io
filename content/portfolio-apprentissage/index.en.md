{{< /lead >}}

## üéØ Competency 2: Optimize Applications

### Level 1: Understand and Build Algorithms

#### CE2.01 - By formalizing and modeling complex situations

**Achieved learnings:**

- Application of design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer)

**Evidence:**
- UML diagram for designing a library management application
- Implementation of MVC pattern in the task management project
- Graded assignment on modeling a reservation system (grade: 16/20)

**Reflection:**
I developed my ability to abstract complex problems using different formalisms. The task management project particularly allowed me to practice object-oriented modeling with a complete MVC architecture. I learned to identify entities, their relationships, and represent them in a clear and maintainable way.

- Knowledge of sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and searching
- Understanding of algorithmic complexity (Big O notation)

**Evidence:**
- Implementation of an AVL tree in Java with automatic rebalancing
- Lab comparing performance of different sorting algorithms
- Use of Dijkstra for route calculation in the carpool app

**Reflection:**
Through various projects and labs, I built a solid algorithmic "toolbox". I now know how to choose the appropriate data structure based on context (HashMap for O(1) access, TreeMap for ordered data, etc.).

### Level 2: Select Appropriate Algorithms to Solve a Given Problem

#### CE2.01 - By formalizing and modeling complex situations

**Achieved learnings:**
- In-depth analysis of constraints before algorithmic choice
- Modeling optimization problems (dynamic programming, greedy algorithms)
- Use of algorithmic design methods (divide and conquer, backtracking)

**Evidence:**
- SAE optimizing the matching system for the carpool application
- Personal project of optimized scheduling algorithm
- Participation in programming competition (ranking: top 15%)

**Reflection:**
I learned not to rush to the first solution. For the carpool application, I first modeled the problem as a weighted graph before choosing a variant of the maximum matching algorithm. This methodical approach allowed me to reduce complexity from O(n¬≥) to O(n¬≤log n).

#### CE2.02 - By cataloging common algorithms and data structures

**Achieved learnings:**
- Advanced use of specialized data structures (Trie, Bloom filter, Skip list)
- Implementation of complex graph algorithms (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A*)
- Mastery of probabilistic and approximation algorithms

**Evidence:**
- Implementation of a Trie for autocompletion in the task manager
- Use of A* algorithm for navigation in a game prototype
- Benchmark comparing Bloom filter vs HashSet for duplicate detection

**Reflection:**
My algorithmic repertoire has significantly expanded. I no longer settle for basic structures but seek the most suitable solutions. For example, using a Bloom filter in the Discord bot reduced memory usage by 90% for spam detection.

#### CE2.03 - By relying on reasoning patterns

**Achieved learnings:**
- Systematic application of algorithmic patterns (two pointers, sliding window)
- Reasoning by recurrence and induction
- Proof of algorithm correctness

**Evidence:**
- Analysis document of my modified merge sort algorithm's correctness
- Solving algorithmic problems with different approaches
- Presentation on "sliding window" pattern to the class

**Reflection:**
I developed a methodical approach to solving algorithmic problems. I always start by identifying the underlying pattern (is it a sliding window problem? dynamic programming?). This method allowed me to efficiently solve 80% of the advanced algorithmic module problems.

#### CE2.04 - By justifying choices and validating results

**Achieved learnings:**
- Comparative analysis of solutions (time, space, readability)
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Validation through unit tests and property tests

**Evidence:**
- Comparative analysis report of 3 algorithms for the recommendation system
- Unit test suite with 95% coverage for the sorting module
- Benchmark graphs showing performance evolution

**Reflection:**
I no longer settle for implementing a solution that "works". For each important algorithmic choice, I document the alternatives considered, reasons for the final choice, and validate through tests. This rigor has prevented several performance issues in production.
