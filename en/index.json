Battery Management # Battery Registration: Easily add new batteries to your inventory by specifying:\nBrand and model Number of cells Capacity (mAh) Type (LiPo, Li-ion, etc.) Purchase date Serial number Custom notes Main Dashboard: View all your batteries and their current status at a glance.\nFiltering and Search: Quickly find a specific battery by status, model, or other criteria.\n2. Status Tracking and Lifecycle Management # Multiple Statuses:\nCharged (ready to use) Discharged (requires charging) In storage (optimal charge level for long-term storage) Out of service (battery to be recycled) Voltage Recording: Document voltage levels at different stages to monitor battery health.\nCycle Counter: Automatic tracking of the number of charge/discharge cycles for each battery.\nUsage History: View the complete history of status changes and usage.\nLifespan Estimation: Calculation of remaining lifespan based on the number of cycles and performance.\n3. QR Code System # Unique QR Code Generation: Automatic creation of a QR code for each registered battery.\nEasy Printing: Export QR codes in formats optimized for printing on durable labels.\nQuick Access: Scanning a QR code instantly directs to the corresponding battery page.\nExpress Status Modification: Quickly change the status of a battery after scanning its QR code.\n4. Alert and Reminder System # Extended Charging Notifications: Alerts for batteries left charging for too long.\nExtended Discharge Alerts: Reminders for batteries left discharged, which can damage them.\nStorage Reminders: Notifications to prepare batteries for long-term storage if unused.\nEnd-of-Life Alerts: Notifications when a battery approaches its theoretical end of life based on cycles.\n5. Statistics and Reports # Analytical Dashboard: Visualize usage trends and the overall status of your battery fleet.\nHealth Reports: Generate detailed reports on the health and performance of each battery.\nUsage Statistics: Track which batteries are most used and which might be underutilized.\nData Export: Export your data in various formats (CSV, PDF) for external analysis.\nTechnical Specifications # Platforms: Application available on Android Storage: Local data storage with cloud synchronization option Performance: Low resource consumption, optimized for field use Connectivity: Offline mode available with automatic synchronization Benefits # Extend the lifespan of your batteries by following best charging and storage practices Avoid in-flight failures through better battery status management Reduce costs by maximizing the lifespan of each battery Save time with a quick identification system using QR codes Improve safety by identifying potentially defective batteries Target Audience #
